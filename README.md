## Deploying to Vercel or Netlify

You can easily deploy this Next.js application to a hosting provider like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### 1. Set Up Your Git Repository

Make sure your code is pushed to a Git repository (e.g., on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).

### 2. Deploy

That's it! The Firebase configuration is already included in the code, so you don't need to set up any environment variables.

#### Deploy with Vercel

1.  Go to your [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/new).
2.  Import your Git repository.
3.  Vercel will automatically detect that it's a Next.js project and configure the build settings for you.
4.  Click **Deploy**.

#### Deploy with Netlify

1.  Go to your [Netlify dashboard](https://app.netlify.com/start).
2.  Connect your Git repository.
3.  Netlify will likely detect the Next.js settings. Ensure the build command is `next build` and the publish directory is `.next`.
4.  Click **Deploy site**.
